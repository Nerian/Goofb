There was, once upon a time, a world were people’s thoughts were private and nobody knew what the neighbor was doing at parties. Those happy times are gone. Facebook have stolen the right of people to have private lives.

GOOF – Get Out Of Facebook – is a project that aims to help people to close their Facebook account and start living a life of freedom. 

Toward that end, GOOF offers a free service that enables the user to retrieve their data from the Facebook servers. Namely, their photos, friend list, profile information and recent activity messages.

The user do not need to install anything, he or she just uses a web interface.
